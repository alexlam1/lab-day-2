# Learning Journal 201 day 2
Today I experienced many setbacks with my js document because I had a for loop and every time i entered the wrong answer then the right one it kept making it repeat itself 4 times. eventually it turned out being I didn't prompt it to move on before the else and after the IF. I also experienced troubles with the  lower casing because I wasn't sure what the || finally after 15 minutes I looked it up on google hahaha. I had fun with this assignment met a lot of stress and setbacks but in the end I was able to get my questionaire to do what  I wanted it to. The css. document was a bit more confusing because id I put in the code but it wasn't out putting on the screen the way I wanted it to. still isn't, I'm sure over time we'll get a better use of it. I was able to get my document to do the coloring how I liked though and that made me happy! The most confusing part of todays assignment was operating in GITBASH I had no idea what I was doing honestly and after going through it with an instructor I didn't retain much of that information. fortunately Brain told me not to worry at all about that.
